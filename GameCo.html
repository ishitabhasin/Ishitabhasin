				<h2>Background:</h2>
				<p>GameCo is a new video game comapny that wants to understand the current market for video games to assess how their new games will fare in the market. Their understanding is that sales in different geographic regions have stayed the same over time. Based on this understanding, they would have to redistribute their marketing budget.</p>
				<h2>Objective</h2>
				<p>As a Data Analyst working for GameCo’s, I should perform a descriptive analysis of a video game data set to give a recommendation of how budget should be allocated.</p>
				<h2>Goal</h2>
				<p>Create a presentation that includes visualizations telling the analytical story.</p>
				<h2>Dataset</h2>
				<p>Historical sales of video games (for games that sold more than 100,000 copies) spanning different platforms, genres, and publishing studios.

								<h2>Step 1- Data Exploration and Data Cleaning </h2>
								<p>Data profiling, data cleaning (duplicates, inconsistencies), integrity checks, filtering, sorting data.
									Grouping and aggregations through Pivot Tables. 
									Storytelling (creating charts on Excel, presenting findings to stakeholders on Power Point).</p>

								<h2>Step 2- Data Analytics</h2>
								<p>Create histograms, bar charts, box and whisker plots, and scatter plots to compare data and discard outliers that affect the main statistics.</p>

								<h2>Step 3- Insights and Data Visualization</h2>
								<p>As opposed to what the company was expecting, sales across the main regions (North America, European Union, and Japan) have not remained same. Overall, the industry’s sales are declining since year 2009. It is important to bear in mind that the data is biased towards retail sales and do not capture accurately the market of software sales, which in turn could depict a different behavior.</p>

								<p>To get a better idea on how to assign the budget, we looked down into the year on year sales in all the 3 regions. We can see that the proportion of sales from EU is gaining track and even surpassing that of NA in 2016. However, in absolute values, NA remains the market with the highest sales for all the remaining years.</p>

								<h2>Conclusion and Findings</h2>
				
										<p>The most important finding is the steep drop in NA sales. This was the biggest market for GameCo over the years, so it is of utmost importance for the company to dig deeper into the cause.</p>
										<p>The second important finding is the slow but steady rise in the European market. That is the direction the company should focus to and icrease their representation.</p>
										<p>As the technological era is advancing so should the companies. This is true for GameCo. as well. They need to tap into the digital market as now more and more games are getting digital.</p>
										<p>The number of mobile users have exponentially increased worldwide and so have the games being downloaded in them. This is still an unknown field and data needs to be collected and worked upon to exactly know which regions are ahead of others</p>
